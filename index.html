	<h1>About Me</h1>
	<p itemprop="description">
	I'm a Certified Professional Midwife (CPM), providing homebirth services in northeast Kansas. Services include comprehensive prenatal care, labor and birth attendance, newborn exams, and postpartum care up to 6 weeks postpartum. I attend waterbirths and VBACs. I have been attending homebirths in the Lawrence area since 1997. 
	</p>
	<p>
	The midwifery care I offer is a culmination of 9 years of midwifery study, 3 years of midwifery school, a 7 1/2 year apprenticeship with a local midwife (1997-2005), 10 years of doula work, the homebirths of my own 3 children and my passion. I am certified by the North American Registry of Midwives (NARM).  I keep my trainings and certifications in Neonatal Resuscitation and adult CPR current.

<h1>Philosophy</h1>
<p>
   I believe pregnancy and birth are natural physiological processes which open and move through a parent's body, mind and spirit. Pregnancy and birth are a part of a deeply personal, deeply intimate journey involving every aspect of a parent's being. It can be a time of great vulnerability and a time of great empowerment. I believe in a pregnant person's ability and right to birth safely, healthfully and joyfully where they choose, how they choose and with whom they choose. Where they feel safe is the safest place for them to birth. 
</p>
<p>
   Birth is a rite of passage for the whole family. Babies are profoundly affected and imprinted during labor and birth in ways of which we are only beginning to recognize. I believe babies have the right to be born into a safe, peaceful, loving environment and into the welcoming arms of the family eagerly awaiting. A baby born into this calm environment and remaining in close physical contact with their family is given a wonderful start. What better way to begin life outside the womb?
